Jekyll has a single, powerful organisational taxonomy, called category.

It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, category, boxes, or anything else. You can think of Jekyll category a lot like Gmail labels. By categorizing posts with single category name, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.

## Basic categorizing

When you write a post, you can assign category to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might categorize some posts with `News` and other posts with `Cycling`, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on `/category/news/` and `/category/cycling/`, respectively.

**NOTE:** You cannot categorize a post with two different category names.

Each category has it's own dedicated home-pages. They have their own pages, their [own RSS feeds](https://gitlab.com/mittalyashu/jasper/issues/5), and can support their own cover images and meta data.

You can find [documentation](https://gitlab.com/mittalyashu/jasper/issues/6) for customizing the theme according to your needs.
