Creating a totally custom design for your publication.

Jekyll comes with a simple default theme called Minima. You can customize the theme according to your needs. However, if you want you can try using Jasper, which is designed to be a clean, readable publication layout and can be easily adapted for most purposes.

We are building different range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can get from here](https://www.gitlab.com/mittalyashu), or you can simply create your own from scratch.

> Anyone can write a completely custom Jekyll theme, with just some solid knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Jekyll themes are written with a templating language called Ruby, which has a bunch of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. Like `{{author.name}}`, for example, outputs the name of the current author.

The best way to learn how to write your own Jekyll theme is to have a look at [the source code for Jasper](https://www.gitlab.com/mittalyashu/jasper), which is heavily commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.

* `default.html` is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically told to use a different template.
* `post.html` is the file used in the context of viewing a post.
* `index.md` is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.
* and so on

We've got full and [extensive theme documentation](https://gitlab.com/mittalyashu/jasper/issues/6) which outlines every template file, context and helper that you can use.

If you want to chat with other people making Jekyll themes to get any advice or help, there's also a **#general** channel in the [Spectrum community](https://spectrum.chat/jekyll) which we always recommend joining!
