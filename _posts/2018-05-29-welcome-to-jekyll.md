Hey! Welcome to Jekyll, it's great to have you :)

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial **Getting Started** posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!

### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. Jekyll is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. If you're using Jekyll for some other purpose, that's fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.
2. The entire theme can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is fully hackable, but doing so does require some knowledge of code. Jekyll is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.
3. For the best experience we recommend you to clone your repository locally on your computer, which is the best way to access your Jekyll site on a desktop device.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```rb
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
```
